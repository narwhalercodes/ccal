How to dev
------------------------------
1. Download an IDE, preferably VSCode.
2. Install C/C++ Compile Run extension from danielpinto8zz6 (https://danielpinto.space) to your VSCode.
3. download tdm64-gcc-10.3.0-2.exe from https://jmeubank.github.io/tdm-gcc/download/ (on windows) and run gcc with VSCode terminal.
4. Clone the repo into perfered location
git clone "https://github.com/narwhalercodes/ccal.git"
5. Once you start editing your first file PLEASE select LF as line ending (bottom right in the VSCode footer).
6. Before your first git add, please make sure you have set the following if you are working on windows!
git config --global core.autocrlf false
7. If I in the future am to accept help from other contributors, I'll probably not disable commits to master but that doesnt mean you are allowed
   to do such disgusting things as not create a new branch and allow for the changes to belong to a PR, regardless if with need of review or not.

8. If you are new to git, check out new to git.txt.


How to set up new prod server
------------------------------
1. Get AWS for free for a year.
2. Create RC2 instance with UDP allowed for ports 7000-8000 from any origin.
3. It will ask for a key-pair, download the .pem file since we will be using ssh.
4. If you mess up the public ip not being set (like me!) you can reuse your security group and key-pair for a new instance.
5. Open powershell and run the ssh-login (see how to deploy step 1).
6. run the following commands:
sudo dnf install git
sudo dnf install gcc
git config --global user.email "example@gmail.com"
git config --global user.name "Example Exampleson"
mkdir repos
cd repos
git clone "https://github.com/narwhalercodes/ccal.git"


How to deploy
------------------------------
1. Open powershell (as admin if you are to install ssh client).
2. Check if you have ssh client installed with the following command. (it should say Name: OpenSSH.Client~~~~0.0.1.0 State : Installed)
Get-WindowsCapability -Online | Where-Object Name -like 'OpenSSH*'
3. Idk what command you use if you dont have it. (sorry)
4. login with powershell to AWS with your secret .pem-file like follows:
ssh -i "../Desktop/instance1-2023.pem" ec2-user@13.51.198.67
5. go to the project and pull
cd /home/ec2-user/repos/ccal/
git pull
6. run the makefile
7. run the executeable in ./center/bin/main.exe
