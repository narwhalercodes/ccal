How to dev:
1. Download an ied, preferably VSCode.
2. download tdm64-gcc-10.3.0-2.exe from https://jmeubank.github.io/tdm-gcc/download/ (on windows) and run gcc with VSCode terminal.

How to set up new prod server:
1. Get AWS for free for a year.
2. Create RC2 instance with UDP allowed for ports 7000-8000 from any origin.
3. It will ask for a key-pair, download the .pem file since we will be using ssh.
4. If you mess up the public ip not being set (like me!) you can reuse your security group and key-pair for a new instance.
5. Open powershell and run the ssh-login (see how to deploy step 1).
6. run the following commands:
sudo dnf install git
sudo dnf install gcc
git config --global user.email "example@gmail.com"
git config --global user.name "Example Exampleson"
mkdir repos
cd repos
git clone "https://github.com/narwhalercodes/ccal.git"

How to deploy:
1. login with powershell to AWS with your secret .pem-file like follows:
ssh -i "./../Desktop/instance1-2023.pem" ec2-user@13.51.198.67
2. go to the project and pull
cd /home/ec2-user/repos/ccal/
git pull
3. run the makefile
4. run the executeable in ./center/bin/main.exe
